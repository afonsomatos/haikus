# haikus
Haiku maker written in Haskell. Probably won't make sense. I made this program while learning Haskell, so the approaches might not be the best.

**Instructions**

1 - Run `makeHaiku.hs` i.e `runHaskell makeHaiku`
2 - Enjoy your new haiku

**Haikus examples**

```
Extraphysical 
Heterogeneously 
Porthole expound phlox

Bisexual plug 
Parroquet honeybloom grope 
Unrhyming sipe culm 
```

**Notes**

- If the file `words/out.txt` is corrupt you might need to run `words/syllabes.hs`
- It might take up to 10 seconds to generate a haiku since it has to process more than 187000 words
